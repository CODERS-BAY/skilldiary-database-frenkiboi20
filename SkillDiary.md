Today it was the turn of the databases. We discussed the DBMS (Database Management System) and the basic structure.
Then we looked at the ERM (Entity Relationship Model) which describes objects and the relationships between them.

-An entity is an object in which information is to be stored.<br>
-Relationship describes the associations between the entities.<br>
-Attributes are the properties of the entities and their relationships.<br>

A frequently used ER model is the Chen notation which graphically shows an overview of all entities and their
relation.

Values ​​are described by primitive data types.<br>
They can be created directly.

### Examples of data types

* int for whole numbers with 32-bit (-2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647)
* varchar for strings
* date to store the date
* boolean for true or false values
* float, double for floating point numbers
* char for a single character

Finally, we did a little exercise on the data types.

### Attributes

* A data type is to be assigned to attributes.

### Keys

* The values ​​of the keys clearly identify the entity
* If there are several key candidates, a primary key must be used (e.g .: ID, SVNR, ISBN, etc.)

### Relationships

* Relationships are grouped into relationship types
* Relationships can also contain attributes

### Relationship types

* Unary: A participating entity
* Binary: Two participating entities
* Ternary: Three participating entities

### Cardinalities

* They describe the relationship more precisely. There are four forms: 1:1 1:N N:1 M:N
* They must always be observed.

Finally, we did an exercise on relationship types and cardinalities

* INTEGRATION
* OPERATION
* CATALOG
* USER VIEW
* INTEGRITY ASSURANCE
* ACCESS CONTROL
* TRANSACTIONS
* SYNCHRONIZATION
* DATA BACKUP<br>
were also terms that we took a closer look at.

The parts into which a transaction is divided:
1. Direct debit
2. Credit
3. Confirmation 

Finally, we modeled Coders Bay on a sheet of paper in an ERM. A higher technical school was shown as an exercise in class.
